- Accessibility (e.g. img alt attributes) - how does this work with the loaded images in gallery? Since they generated in DOM
- Animated splash screen:
    - Initial down arrows
    - Logo draw ()
    - Migrate to header (or disappear on mobile?)
    - Only on first visit/session, if page is refreshed (cached?), then skip
- Softer page load:
    - Images to fade in sequentially
- Replace the C.O.B. text element of "NOTORIOUS C.O.B." in header
- Background graphics on About and Contact pages*
- Browser tab Favicon (mini COB logo)
- Debug pinch zoom effect on modal
- Set up proper footer on zoho email
- Pop-up to notify user on page - contact message successfully sent
- Check about automatic contact form receipt acknowledgment (is this professional from info@? Or should it be a do-not-reply? OR sod it off?)
- Security concerns - set up Captcha (), rate limiting, honeypot field
- Refactor Javascript and CSS (clean it all up)
